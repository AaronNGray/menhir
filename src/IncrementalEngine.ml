open General

(* This signature describes the incremental LR engine. *)

(* In this mode, the user controls the lexer, and the parser suspends
   itself when it needs to read a new token. *)

module type INCREMENTAL_ENGINE = sig

  type token

  (* The type ['a checkpoint] represents an intermediate or final state of the
     parser. An intermediate checkpoint is a suspension: it records the parser's
     current state, and allows parsing to be resumed. The parameter ['a] is
     the type of the semantic value that will eventually be produced if the
     parser succeeds. *)

  (* [Accepted] and [Rejected] are final checkpoints. [Accepted] carries a
     semantic value. *)

  (* [InputNeeded] is an intermediate checkpoint. It means that the parser wishes
     to read one token before continuing. *)

  (* [Shifting] is an intermediate checkpoint. It means that the parser is taking
     a shift transition. It exposes the state of the parser before and after
     the transition. The Boolean parameter tells whether the parser intends to
     request a new token after this transition. (It always does, except when
     it is about to accept.) *)

  (* [AboutToReduce] is an intermediate checkpoint. It means that the parser is
     about to perform a reduction step. It exposes the parser's current
     state as well as the production that is about to be reduced. *)

  (* [HandlingError] is an intermediate checkpoint. It means that the parser has
     detected an error and is currently handling it, in several steps. *)

  type env

  type production

  type 'a checkpoint = private
    | InputNeeded of env
    | Shifting of env * env * bool
    | AboutToReduce of env * production
    | HandlingError of env
    | Accepted of 'a
    | Rejected

  (* [offer] allows the user to resume the parser after it has suspended
     itself with a checkpoint of the form [InputNeeded env]. [offer] expects the
     old checkpoint as well as a new token and produces a new checkpoint. It does not
     raise any exception. *)

  val offer:
    'a checkpoint ->
    token * Lexing.position * Lexing.position ->
    'a checkpoint

  (* [resume] allows the user to resume the parser after it has suspended
     itself with a checkpoint of the form [AboutToReduce (env, prod)] or
     [HandlingError env]. [resume] expects the old checkpoint and produces a new
     checkpoint. It does not raise any exception. *)

  val resume:
    'a checkpoint ->
    'a checkpoint

  (* A token supplier is a function of no arguments which delivers a new token
     (together with its start and end positions) every time it is called. *)

  type supplier =
    unit -> token * Lexing.position * Lexing.position

  (* A pair of a lexer and a lexing buffer can be easily turned into a supplier. *)

  val lexer_lexbuf_to_supplier:
    (Lexing.lexbuf -> token) ->
    Lexing.lexbuf ->
    supplier

  (* The functions [offer] and [resume] are sufficient to write a parser loop.
     One can imagine many variations (which is why we expose these functions
     in the first place!). Here, we expose a few variations of the main loop,
     ready for use. *)

  (* [loop supplier checkpoint] begins parsing from [checkpoint], reading
     tokens from [supplier]. It continues parsing until it reaches a
     checkpoint of the form [Accepted v] or [Rejected]. In the former case, it
     returns [v]. In the latter case, it raises the exception [Error]. *)

  val loop: supplier -> 'a checkpoint -> 'a

  (* [loop_handle succeed fail supplier checkpoint] begins parsing from
     [checkpoint], reading tokens from [supplier]. It continues parsing until
     it reaches a checkpoint of the form [Accepted v] or [HandlingError env]
     (or [Rejected], but that should not happen, as [HandlingError _] will be
     observed first). In the former case, it calls [succeed v]. In the latter
     case, it calls [fail] with this checkpoint. It cannot raise [Error].

     This means that Menhir's traditional error-handling procedure (which pops
     the stack until a state that can act on the [error] token is found) does
     not get a chance to run. Instead, the user can implement her own error
     handling code, in the [fail] continuation. *)

  val loop_handle:
    ('a -> 'answer) ->
    ('a checkpoint -> 'answer) ->
    supplier -> 'a checkpoint -> 'answer

  (* The abstract type ['a lr1state] describes the non-initial states of the
     LR(1) automaton. The index ['a] represents the type of the semantic value
     associated with this state's incoming symbol. *)

  type 'a lr1state

  (* An element is a pair of a non-initial state [s] and a semantic value [v]
     associated with the incoming symbol of this state. The idea is, the value
     [v] was pushed onto the stack just before the state [s] was entered. Thus,
     for some type ['a], the state [s] has type ['a lr1state] and the value [v]
     has type ['a]. In other words, the type [element] is an existential type. *)

  type element =
    | Element: 'a lr1state * 'a * Lexing.position * Lexing.position -> element

  (* The parser's stack is (or, more precisely, can be viewed as) a stream of
     elements. *)

  type stack =
    element stream

  (* This is the parser's stack, a stream of elements. This stream is empty if
     the parser is in an initial state; otherwise, it is non-empty.  The LR(1)
     automaton's current state is the one found in the top element of the
     stack. *)

  val stack: env -> stack

  (* These are the start and end positions of the current lookahead token. It
     is legal to invoke this function only after at least one token has been
     offered to the parser via [offer]. In other words, it is illegal to
     invoke it in an initial state. *)

  val positions: env -> Lexing.position * Lexing.position

end

(* This signature is a fragment of the inspection API that is made available
   to the user when [--inspection] is used. This fragment contains type
   definitions for symbols. *)

module type SYMBOLS = sig

  (* The type ['a terminal] represents a terminal symbol. The type ['a
     nonterminal] represents a nonterminal symbol. In both cases, the index
     ['a] represents the type of the semantic values associated with this
     symbol. The concrete definitions of these types are generated. *)

  type 'a terminal
  type 'a nonterminal

  (* The type ['a symbol] represents a terminal or nonterminal symbol. It is
     the disjoint union of the types ['a terminal] and ['a nonterminal]. *)

  type 'a symbol =
    | T : 'a terminal -> 'a symbol
    | N : 'a nonterminal -> 'a symbol

  (* The type [xsymbol] is an existentially quantified version of the type
     ['a symbol]. This type is useful in situations where the index ['a]
     is not statically known. *)

  type xsymbol =

  (* The type [production] is meant to be the same as in [INCREMENTAL_ENGINE].
     It represents a production of the grammar. A production can be examined
     via the functions [lhs] and [rhs] below. *)

  type production

  (* An LR(0) item is a pair of a production [prod] and a valid index [i] into
     this production. That is, if the length of [rhs prod] is [n], then [i] is
     comprised between 0 and [n], inclusive. *)

  (* [incoming_symbol s] is the incoming symbol of the state [s], that is,
     the symbol that the parser must recognize before (has recognized when)
     it enters the state [s]. This function gives access to the semantic
     value [v] stored in a stack element [Element (s, v, _, _)]. Indeed,
     by case analysis on the symbol [incoming_symbol s], one discovers the
     type ['a] of the value [v]. *)

  val incoming_symbol: 'a lr1state -> 'a symbol

  (* [items s] is the set of the LR(0) items in the LR(0) core of the LR(1)
     state [s]. This set is not epsilon-closed. This set is presented as a
     list, in an arbitrary order. *)

  val items: _ lr1state -> item list

  (* [lhs prod] is the left-hand side of the production [prod]. This is
     always a non-terminal symbol. *)

  val lhs: production -> xsymbol

  (* [rhs prod] is the right-hand side of the production [prod]. This is
     a (possibly empty) sequence of (terminal or nonterminal) symbols. *)

  val rhs: production -> xsymbol list

     That is, it is true if and only if this symbol produces the empty
     word [epsilon]. *)

  val nullable: _ nonterminal -> bool

  (* [first nt t] tells whether the FIRST set of the nonterminal symbol [nt]
     contains the terminal symbol [t]. That is, it is true if and only if
     [nt] produces a word that begins with [t]. *)

  val first: _ nonterminal -> _ terminal -> bool

  (* [xfirst] is analogous to [first], but expects a first argument of type
     [xsymbol] instead of [_ terminal]. *)

  val xfirst: xsymbol -> _ terminal -> bool

  (* [foreach_terminal] enumerates the terminal symbols, including [error].
     [foreach_terminal_but_error] enumerates the terminal symbols, excluding
