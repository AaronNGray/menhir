This directory contains quick tests for Menhir and MenhirLib.
They are supposed to help avoid mistakes and guide choices
while developing, but they are not very serious.

The files are as follows:

config.sh        Shared variables.

build.sh         Builds Menhir and MenhirLib from scratch,
                 and re-installs MenhirLib using ocamlfind.

calc             A modified version of the calc demo.

calc-data        Test inputs and reference outputs.

trustme.sh       Reconstructs the reference outputs.

test.sh          Runs the calc demo with the test inputs
                 and compares the outputs with the reference
                 outputs.

gene             Another version of the calc demo, bundled
                 with its own random generator of (long)
                 test inputs.
